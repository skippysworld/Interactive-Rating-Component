## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Major take away was realizing how easily you can forgot everything after very short time. I took some time to learn a JavaScript and forgot near to half of HTML / CSS meanwhile.

### Continued development

I'd like to get back to a CSS and make it a little tidier. I've feeling it's pretty bad and could be made better using less code.
